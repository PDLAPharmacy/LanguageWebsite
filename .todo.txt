Hello team,
We have been trying to integrate the template/theme you have sent us for the Spanish Learning Website but after integration the login functionality seemed to have been broken.

We've tried many things to fix this problem. We've tried the following things.

Using this in auth.php.
'providers' => [
'admins' => [ 'driver' => 'eloquent', 'model' => App\Models\Admin::class, ],

Using SESSION_DRIVER=redis in .env.

Regards,
Justin and Adrian
